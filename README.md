# Symphony Life Manager

A minimalist life management hub with intelligent AI assistance for goal setting, task management, and routines.

## Core Features

- **Dynamic To-Do List Interface**: A simple, single-column view showing immediate and relevant upcoming tasks, dynamically updated.
- **Natural Language Task Input**: Ability to add tasks using plain language, with initial AI parsing to identify actions, due dates, and potential links to goals.
- **Goal & Task Hierarchy Foundation**: Implement the basic data structure for Goals, Milestones, Tasks, and Routines, allowing manual creation and linking initially. Goals should support fixed deadlines or recurring reviews.
- **Basic AI Task Breakdown/Suggestion**: When a task is entered (especially a higher-level one), the AI suggests potential sub-tasks or required steps.
- **Calendar Integration**: Display upcoming calendar events within or alongside the daily task view.
- **Minimalist Design**: Ensure a clean, functional, and visually appealing interface from the outset.
